# Flappy Bird Team Work

Welcome to our Flappy Bird WPF project! In this repository, we've recreated the classic Flappy Bird game using Microsoft Visual Studio, WPF, and C# programming language. This project serves as a learning exercise for our team of three computer science students, where we've implemented the game following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern.

## Features

 - Classic Flappy Bird gameplay with pipes and a gap for the bird to fly through.

 - Scoring system based on how many pipes the player successfully navigates.

 - Two small clouds scrolling in the background to enhance the gaming experience.

## Project Structure

Our project follows the MVVM architecture, which separates the application into three main components:

 - **Model**: Contains the game logic and data representation, such as the bird's position, pipes, and score calculation.

 - **View**: Consists of XAML markup defining the visual layout of the game UI, including the bird, pipes, score display, and background elements.

 - **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, handling user input, updating the UI, and managing the game state.
